<h1>JamBreaker: Term 2 Final PERN Stack Project ðŸš—</h1>

  
This app was designed as a way to make important data about traffic patterns and conditions accessible to both commuters and traffic engineers who need it. The dataset I used is from Kaggle with categories such as:
- Traffic Volume (Number of vehicles on the road per hour)
- Holidays (If there was a holiday that day)
- Weather (Weather conditions hourly)
- and more...

<h1>Functionality</h1>
The main functionality allows for the user to interact with the data through 3 different outlets.
