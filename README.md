<h1>JamBreaker: Term 2 Final PERN Stack Project 🚗</h1>

  
This app was designed as a way to make important historical data from 2012-2018 about traffic patterns and conditions accessible to both commuters and traffic engineers who need it. The dataset I used is from Kaggle with categories such as:
<br>
- Traffic Volume (Number of vehicles on the road per hour)
- Holidays (If there was a holiday that day)
- Weather (Weather conditions hourly)
- and more...
<h1>Functionality</h1>
The main functionality allows for the user to interact with the data through 3 different outlets:

- Bar Chart: Compares different weather conditions and their average traffic volume
- Line Chart: Charts the average traffic volume per month
- Heatmap: Shows average daily traffic volume.
- More to hopefully come as I add on to this project. 🙂

<h1>Languages and Technologies Used</h1>
This project mainly used the PERN stack as it's main technology stack. I chose this mainly due to it's overall utility and as a good way to gain an understanding  
of webapp and fullstack developement. 

<h2>PostgreSQL 🐘</h2>
PostgreSQL, or Postgres is a backend SQL framework used for a vast range of applications, and due to it's flexibility and ability to work with JSON formats, it was a great choice for my project. One of the best features is the ability to import CSV files into a Postgres data table, which made the process of filtering and fetching the data much easier.
  

<h2>Express</h2>
Expressjs is a flexible middleware framework used for managing routing between Nodejs and the Postgres database, along with handling CRUD commands.
